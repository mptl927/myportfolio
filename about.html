          <h3 id="my-story-heading"> My Story</h3>
          <p class="my-story-text">I started out as a physical therapist in a skilled nursing facility. When I started my career, I loved it. I loved having a job that was so people-oriented. I loved being able to use my creativity and passion to help someone return home. Most importantly, I loved the genuine connections I made despite the decades between my patients and myself. I was really able to refine my ability to make lasting relationships with various types of people that I encountered. </p>

<p class="my-story-text">As the years went by, the fire burned out. The reason I became a therapist, to help people become the best versions of themselves, became a speck far into the horizon. I became disillusioned with the state of healthcare.  As much as I loved my patients, the job itself was not what it once was. I decided I needed a change. </p>

<p class="my-story-text">So, I chose design.</p>

<p class="my-story-text">Admittedly, I did not know what I was doing or what I was getting myself into when I chose the design path. I knew hard work and dedication would ensue, but I was ready. </p>

<p class="my-story-text">I have always maintained an active interest in painting as a hobby. I wanted to apply an existing, artistic passion to the growing design world to create something bigger than myself. </p>


<p class="my-story-text">I’m committed to using both my communication and interpersonal skills as a therapist as well as my artistic sensibilities to design modern products and bridge the gap between businesses and their consumers. I’m excited to combine my passion for people and design to solve today’s problems for the future of tomorrow.
