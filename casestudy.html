What started out with a simple idea to bring people together became Nebula.
        </p>
        <p class="process-text-content"> Like all projects, we had to start somewhere. In this case, I started with research and analysis of existing apps and research of current and potential users of this new app. I then gathered all the information from surveys and created user personas and stories: what types of people I thought would benefit from a new cloud storage app like Nebula, and what those users would want from this app. Meanwhile, I was able to create a brand identity, color palette, logos etc, to come up with an overall look and feel of Nebula.  From there, the pieces of the puzzle started to fit together. I was able to come up with wireframes, mockups, and, ultimately, prototypes that were tested both in person and remotely.

Other notable points were that a majority of people would like to comment on other’s work, have the ability to choose between a public and a private profile, and have this service be used both personally and professionally.

            <p class="ca-content"> The cloud storage market already has a few “big” names, however I found a great opportunity to delve into the market with Nebula.
            </p>
            <p class="ca-content"> I compared Google Drive, OneDrive, and DropBox. The biggest strengths of all three services include availability on multiple platforms (iOS, Android, web) and easy organization.
            </p>
            <p class="ca-content">A major weakness for Google Drive was that you can only use Drive if you have a Google account. Furthermore, viewing and commenting on other’s work is not easily accessible without the file being shared with you.
            </p>
            <p class=ca-content>DropBox’s weaknesses include not enough free storage and increased security risks.
            </p>
            <p class=ca-content>OneDrive’s weaknesses include difficulty sharing files as well as vulnerability to hackers.
            </p>
            <p class=ca-content>To address these issues with the competitors, Nebula provides more space for lower costs, allows users to browse public content and request access to private content, and makes it easy to share files with social media, links, and e-mails.

            <p class="branding-text-content"> As I was working through the wireframes and mockups, I was envisioning what the brand identity would be. I came up with a style guide, a name, and logos. I came up with the name Nebula and the color palette that comes along with that including purples, pinks, blues and greens. The word nebula brings to mind the idea of infinite, limitless space and possibilities and that’s what I wanted to convey with the branding of this app: infinite, limitless possibilities to create, share and collaborate.</p>

            <h3 class="branding-text-content"> Possibilities. Creation. Collaboration. Sharing. Community. Friends. Limitless. Infinite.</h3>
            <p class="branding-text-content"> Once I narrowed down the brand characteristics, it was a key step in creating the logo, color palette, typography, and overall brand identity. </p>
            <p class="branding-text-content"> When I thought about “cloud storage”, I wanted to do a play on the word “cloud”. The more I thought about it, the more I realized that clouds are limiting. So I thought bigger. I delved into the idea of space, the galaxies that make up the universe. From there, I thought about how all components like matter, space, galaxies, etc come together to create something beautiful. I wanted to translate that into Nebula and highlight the community and collaboration aspect of the app to create something bigger.</p>
            <p class="branding-text-content"> Here are the initial variations for the logos I’ve come up with:</p>

            <p class="prototyping-text"> For both prototypes, I did both in person and remote testing. For each test, each person was able to correctly complete all the tasks asked of them. I was able to get more feedback about the look and feel of the app and implement those changes for the final design. For example, there was a user icon in the top right corner that was removed because it was counterintuitive when there is also a user profile pic in the navigation menu. Furthermore, the initial prototype did not easily allow the user to move and share their files and folders, so a screen and process was added to make this clearer and easier for the user to complete.</p>
            <p class="prototyping-text"> One of the last steps of testing was performing a preference test on three different aspects of the design. I tested the color and style of the buttons and the color of the logo. After reviewing the results, it was clear to see what worked and what didn’t work. </p>

            <p class="conclusion-text-content"> Going into this project, I did not know what to expect. The cloud storage market seems saturated, I didn’t know what I could do to set Nebula apart from the rest. Once I got over the initial hump of not knowing how or when to start, it all started to come together easier. The most crucial part of the whole process for me was the user surveys. This set the tone for the whole project. I was able to find out what users wanted from a new cloud storage app and what they didn’t. At this stage, it was still slightly difficult to picture the final project. Once I came up with what needed to be included, it was much easier to start the wireframing process. This was another important part of the process as this created the structure of the app that I was aiming for. The more research I did, the easier the pieces started to fall into place.</p>
            <p class="conclusion-text-content"> My biggest doubts for this project were taking a blank slate and coming up with a final, whole piece with very little to start with. It was frustrating at times to not be able to see the big, final picture. The thing that surprised me the most about the process was how things started to flow towards the end of the project. It was amazing to start with a very vague project brief and come up with a final, working prototype with a unique, fresh brand identity. </p>
            <p class="conclusion-text-content"> If I had more time, I would use it to flesh out more screens and specific processes for the app. I would have also tried to do more in depth research to come up with the perfect design, color scheme and feel for the overall project. </p>
            <p class="conclusion-text-content"> My biggest takeaway from doing this project was that I was able to start from nothing and make it into something real. It made me realize that I have more potential than I thought I did. I also learned that while the process could be frustrating and nerve-wrecking at times, it all led to a final, cohesive product. I learned how important it is to try different approaches to make sure you come up with the most appropriate one. </p>
